# PRP - Personal Resource Planning

PRP is an implementation of a simplified ERP, for a person, hence the name PRP - Personal Resource Planning. It was born out of my wish to have a more controlled money management system, given that the Excel spreadsheet can support only so much complexity. For this project, I had to revisit my knowlegde about accounting for developing the first module.
